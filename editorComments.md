Meta-reviewer's comments

The reviewers agreed that the paper is relevant to the journal, and that it should be included. One recommended minor typographic corrections, and the other more extensive reworking to enhance non-technical aspects.

This is a fascinating system, and the approach of describing it against the background of performance-led development works well, providing in-line, formative evaluation.

> The success of an algorithm used for livecoding is to some extent how easy it is to change, how malleable it is

as a suggestion, reference one of the cognitive dimensions of notation here, which might provide further dimensions along which success (or otherwise) could be measured/considered.




This needs a thorough proofread. 

+ For example, please fix all the "it's". Either expand to "it is" or remove the apostrophe, according to accepted grammar rules. -- done (tb)
+ There are cases where an apostrophe should be added -- dave?
+ and many other grammatical glitches and spelling errors,  -- dave?
+ plus inconsistent capitalisation of TOPLAP. -- done (tb)


+ reference other work in the live coding field. 
+ review any related work, e.g. using limited instruction sets or microcontrollers (Beta blocker is certainly an outlier in terms of interfaces, so I realise this context may be limited)

+ expand cultural aspects
+ tell more about the first performance (piksel fest)
+ A/V examples for the DVD are a necessity
+ more 'images', like "Figure 10. Performing at the SuperCollider symposium 2012, London", less 'flow charts & Block diagrams' 
+ use images to describe the performance potential or the 'new ideas for artistic use' and livecoding practice in public performances. 
+ Would be great to hear the 'greater sonic possibilities'.



+ it is said that we take "an overtly technical view on how 'Betablocker' was driven by a need to escape conventions of office-based programming'"
+ we do not "really give an in-depth reason to why, and even impl[y] that [...] perhaps office programming is a given, [...] 
+ we reify this type of engagement when perhaps it is simply a 'strand' of approaches to the computer.
+ we are encouraged to give more of an insight into the cultural or political consequences of material of computation


### Reviewer 1

*Comments*

+ The author writes that 'in livecoding performances, as a way of escaping a feeling of being ’stuck in a creative rut’. It would be insightful if the writer could explain some of these matters of mind and the extension of the senses through technologies of cognition and perception that he term 'Betablocker' implies.
+ Figure 7. needs to be single line formatted

> "Piksel Festival Begen: This was a 20 minute solo livecoding performance using a gamepad as the only input mechanism"

As a reader I would like to have an indication of what and how the 'performer' performed, f the gamepad was the only input was there gestures moving to the a/v what was the 'dramaturgical relationship of the live code and this relationship to the interface'?

if indeed it was a performance was the 'audience' affect considered or what was the 'response' or atmosphere created by the live performance event.


### Reviewer 2

*Is the subject matter and presentation appropriate for Computer Music Journal?*

Yes, without question.

*Does the paper meet its stated goals; are they meaningful for the material?*

Yes.

*Are the ideas presented clearly; is the presentation well organized?*

Yes.

*Have the authors ignored significant work or contradictory results?*

Not that I am aware of.

*What (if any) material should be added or deleted to improve this manuscript?*

If you need to cut, the section discussing the various performances could probably be made more concise, and/or focus on the most interesting cases.

It's probably beyond the scope of this, but some discussion of how the self-modifying code approaches might be adapted for more complex systems would be interesting.

*Does the paper require any additional audio and/or video material in order to be evaluated by you or understood by readers?*

No, but AV examples would be nice of course.

*As a summary, would you say that the article should: be published in Computer Music Journal with minor revisions (as specified)*

Yes. Could use a close edit for typos, small grammatical errors, etc. 'its' vs. 'it's' a recurring if not completely consistent mistake. (Maybe autocorrect getting out of hand?)
