Till: I thought of doing a backlog description of my adaptation...
Till: somehow there's a lot of insight in there that is IMHO valuable
Till: decision processes etc.
Till: is it ok for you to not talk too much about "livecoding performance" but rather to talk about livecoding?
Till: because IMHO, livecoding is more than just performance practice
Dave: ok, for me it's key, but understand your and julians approach is less about this
Dave: btw is 25 pages what we are aiming for, or can it be quite a bit shorter?
Till: it can be shorter, of course
Till: I altered your introduction...
Till: do you still have time to read that part now? it's about 5 sentences...
Till: // this is orginal:
Computation is odd. 
In fact in many ways it's one of the strangest things that have been discovered, and 77 years on we continue to fail to fully grasp it's behaviour and so, struggle to keep unseen ramifications of our decisions under control. Faced with such a strange and yet essential beast the only sane strategy is to try and tame it. 
The field of software engineering is littered with concepts such as regression testing, type checking, white rooms, sandboxing, contracts, and encapsulation -- all attempts to cope with the fact that we can't really understand how a mundane machine of sufficient complexity will act when it is programmed by a human.

Livecoders look this beast straight in the eyes. 
When a livecoding performer takes to the stage and projects her screen, she invites us to join her in attempting to understand this intricate dance between human and machine. 

// here I start to alter:
But livecoding is more than performance practice.
It is a broad field that can be viewed from many different angles.
From rehearsed public performances, reaching over collaborative improvisations and individual sound explorations, to it's utilisation as a method in science, it has been utilised in a manifold of applications.
All these derivations of the original theme share elements of live coding as they are featured in the toplap manifesto.
So livecoding is attempting to treat computation as a material on it's own terms, pick it up and feel what shapes it has.

Betablocker is an approach to livecoding which has brought to light many different strategies for presenting computation as a tangible material -- and it does this by making this process as much part of the performance as the code that describes it.
Built around this element is a variety of applications for testing, performing and scientific investigations.
Dave: sounds good
Dave: but I was concerned with the fact it was a music journal
Dave: so trying to boost those aspects
Dave: dunno if that's a consideration
Dave: brb
Till: well, CMJ is a technical music journal
Till: and this is a special issue
Till: also, IMHO, we can put a focus on sonic research/artistic research
Till: and then of course to sound and performance as well.
Dave: ok
Dave: well ~25 pages is loads more than I expected :)
Till: we'll succeed with what we have as content.
Till: let's not force it to anything, just write what we have and that's it, ok?
Till: better short than lenghty
Dave: agreed
Dave: what do you want me to work on next?
Till: if you don't mind, the intro (Betablocker, a virtual stack machine)?
Dave: Ok
Till: but then again, it's up to you where you want to add things.
Dave: I should move betablocker ds to github also
Dave: I would like to add the inner loop of the interpreter as a appendix
Dave: the switch statement basically
Dave: how far (if at all) do you think I should go into the code evolving strategies (genetic algorithms and dawinistic)
Till: hm...
Till: adding the switch statement is a good idea
Till: maybe in a commented form...
Dave:    case NOP: break;
    case ORG: m_start=m_start+m_pc-1; m_pc=1; break;
    case EQU: push(pop()==pop()); break;
    case JMP: m_pc=peek(m,m_pc++); break;
    case JMPZ: if (pop()==0) m_pc=peek(m,m_pc); else m_pc++; break;
    case PSHL: push(peek(m,m_pc++)); break;
    case PSH: push(peek(m,peek(m,m_pc++))); break;
    case PSHI: push(peek(m,peek(m,peek(m,m_pc++)))); break;
    case POP: poke(m,peek(m,m_pc++),pop()); break;
    case POPI: poke(m,peek(m,peek(m,m_pc++)),pop()); break;
    case ADD: push(pop()+pop()); break;
    case SUB: push(pop()-pop()); break;
    case INC: push(pop()+1); break;
    case DEC: push(pop()-1); break;
    case AND: push(pop()&pop()); break;
    case OR: push(pop()|pop()); break;
    case XOR: push(pop()^pop()); break;
    case NOT: push(~pop()); break;
    case ROR: push(pop()>>peek(m,m_pc++)); break;
    case ROL: push(pop()<<peek(m,m_pc++)); break;
    case PIP: 
    {
        u8 d=peek(m,m_pc++); 
        poke(m,d,peek(m,d)+1); 
    } break;
    case PDP: 
    {
        u8 d=peek(m,m_pc++); 
        poke(m,d,peek(m,d)-1); 
    } break;
    case DUP: push(top()); break;
Till: maybe something like this?

http://tai-studio.org/index.php/2011/08/betablocker-ugen-layout/
Dave: oh yes - that's nice
Dave: I think for genetic bizness, perhaps just go into how it's working on arduino processors
Dave: with the special IN and OUT instructions
Till: what I'd like to see is your automation process to generate specific output
Dave: for pin i/o
Dave: ah yes - the fft stuff
Dave: would be good to write that up some more and do some recordings
Dave: http://www.pawfal.org/dave/blog/2012/11/spork-factory/
Dave: connects nicely with your work too
Dave: I had this great setup where it would spit the fittest program to the chip after each generation
Dave: so you could hear it evolve
Dave: (as well as a sonification of the software as it did the flash memory write)
Till: this one:
http://www.pawfal.org/dave/blog/2011/10/evolving-musical-bytecode-3/
Dave: ah ok
Till: yepp, and the spork factory is nice as well
Dave: the eventual plan is to do livecoding by moving around self modifying programmable objects
Dave: hundreds of them :)
Till: also, I think this 
http://tai-studio.org/index.php/2012/06/betablocker-example-code/
might be interesting as a first step
Till: and then RULE THE WORLD™
Till: with the smallscale objects
Dave: so we could have example programs for both approaches (fast and slow) then move on to our more advanced approaches
Till: ok
Till: so, 


+ BetaBlocker core
+ slow computing
+ lightspeed computing
+ complex computing

?
Till: it's a bit like having a core and then unfolding it
Dave: "towards self-livecoding software"
Till: unfolding self-livecoding software
Till: unfolding self-livecoding capabilities of the betablocker platform
Till: ?
Dave: unfolding self modification as livecode collaboration
Till: who collaborates?
Dave: human and machine, well
Dave: human can act as if this is happening
Dave: which provides a more "normal" interaction
Dave: referencing nick collins' stuff with machine music processes and live performance
Till: you: "I'd like to stress the combination of
human and machine rather than imply that betablocker is doing anything
clever, or has a voice of it's own -"
Dave: yes - the complexity is in the human's interpretation of a simple machine
Till: then we have to explicitely tell that
Dave: we want them to be like us so we suspend disbelief
Till: maybe that is the core here?
Dave: perhaps
Dave: tangibility is in the mind of the human
Till: actually, you could imagine the BBlocker stuff to be a companion in livecoding, something that helps you to get around that blank-page syndrome we're all suffering from.
Dave: somehow an anti-"skeumorph" message
Dave: unfolding things that are sincere to their true nature rather than pasting interfaces over them
Dave: results in higher tangibility
Dave: dunno
Till: and I also like the fact that, although the output of a given bblockerstack is deteministic, it still is a mystery (i.e. not determinable) for the human mind
Dave: that is the key point
Dave: good stuff
Till: ok, so now we have the key point.
Dave: so - we make something that is really dumb
Dave: and still we can't understand it
Till: well...
Dave: and it's exciting to use
Till: ok
Till: (I most often do not understand the dumbest things possible being made...)
Till: (but then again, they're mostly not fun to use)
Till: :)
Dave: "although the output of a given bblockerstack is deteministic, it still is a mystery (i.e. not determinable) for the human mind - we want them to be like us so we suspend disbelief as a way to gain a tangible understanding"
Dave: is perhaps the core idea?
Till: about the paper outline then, I'd say something like


+ intro
+ unfolding self modification to livecode collaboration
Till: too early posted...
Till: wait a sec
Dave: great that we can lift so much from our blogs
Till: isn't it?
Till: + intro

+ Betablocker core technology
++ describing the theoretical background and implementation (switch statement etc.)

+ unfolding self modification to livecode collaboration
++ slow computing
++ sound computing
++ genetic computing

+ Meta-discussion
++ complex computing in art
++ and as artistic research practice
Till: this ^^ would be my take
Till: what is still missing is the sound aesthetic part...
Dave: sounds good
Till: but somehow, it'd be nice to fit that into the artistic research practice...
Till: hm...
Till: would you say that we purely focus on descriptive elements in the unfolding section?
Till: descriptive in the sense that we explain the unfolding part and then go on with describing the different approaches
Dave: no - I think it's important to talk of the 'whys' in the unfolding
Dave: i.e. put it in artistic context
Till: yes, sure....
Till: that's what I meant with explain the unfolding part
Till: because I see at least three levels here:

technology
unfolding as performance/research practice/method (conceptual and descriptive)
aesthetic qualities
Till: but now, I have to run for food
Till: ...
Till: sorry... I'm meeting Callum
Dave: ok, just a heads up - I have 2 EU proposals due this week, a talk next week and teaching 20 8-12 yr olds how to program scratch on tuesday, so
Till: :D
Till: a lot to do
Dave: might be a bit distracted
Till: but it's good to have the structure up and running
Dave: yes
Till: have you seen this, btw. ?
http://tai-studio.org/index.php/projects/deind/
Till: my first funded project...
Dave: yes looks very nice
Dave: congratulations!
Till:  but now I'm off
see you soon :)
Dave: laters
Till: I'm atm rearranghing things in the file to reflect our discussion
Till: ok, I'm done with this for today.
have fun!
Dave: okdoke
Dave: will try and have a look later in the week
Till: k
Till: nice working on this with you, btw.
Dave: ditto
Dave: also great procrastination vehicle
Till: I start to get into it again.
Till: what is procrastination to you is actual work for me...
Till: what's the EU projects about?
Dave: me too, of course
Dave: eu - more livecoding + creative industries, and some craft one about food
Till: nice :)
Till: have a position for me there?
Till: :D
Dave: perhaps
Dave: well definately hoping to do some betablocker for it
Till: I am also willing to read through the proposal(s) if you ask nicely
Dave: sure, all a mess atm though
Dave: deadline friday :(
Till: okok
Till: see you after that
Till: :)
Till: for your spork factory; maybe it'd be useful to add a DAC to the equation? e.g.: http://www.ti.com/product/dac0802&lpos=Middle_Container&lid=Alternative_Devices
Till: :)
Dave: why would you ever need more than 1 bit sound?
Dave: _quadrophonic_ 1 bit sound at that
Till: oho...
Till: just say'in
Dave: yeah, it was a bit proof of concept
Dave: simplest output possible
Dave: i also always debug microproccesor with piezos anyway
Till: Ö=
Till: ups
Till: :)
Till: also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder
Till: hey dave,
Till: hope your deadline is doing ok
Dave: hmm
Dave: 80 pages of joy
Till: I made some changes to the text today, not an aweful lot but just something to check in...
Dave: ok grea
Dave: t
Till: I increasingly get unsure about what it'll be after all but hey, let's find out on the way :)
Dave: when is the deadline again?
Till: 20 + 7
Dave: 20 days
Dave: no worries
Dave: end of month?
Till: 28th for us
Till: official is 21.
Till: I think, what I'd like to add a disclaimer abotu the scope of the paper reading simething along the lines of "This paper collects experiences, challenges and insights gathered over the course of 3 years being engaged in combining live coding techniques with virtual chips."
Dave: I would still like to hit proper deadline
Till: I'm not against it, though I'm not sure we'll make it...
Dave: Quite happy to fit it in with a specific idea/methodology if you have one in mind
Till: "Soon after starting the project, it became evident that complex behaviour can emerge out of simple instructions and self-alteration of code.
Till: "
Till: hm...
Till: or something along those lines...
Dave: thing is
Dave: tons of genetic programming/alife stuff in the 90's
Till: what I wanted to say is actually that we have a bunch of different insights
Dave: yes
Dave: artistic approach
Dave: a research project grounded in tech
Till: broad approach
Dave: but driven by artistic direction
Till: an artistic research project grounded in thechnical theory
Dave: with livecoding as method
Dave: sumfink like that
Dave: or
Dave: maybe talk about our approaches personally
Dave: you escaping science
Dave: me not really having a clue
Dave: i mean
Dave: trying to be more methodical
Dave: meeting in the middle?
Till: I like the idea to talk about our experiences individually
Till: the other day I had this idea of making an interview of each other
Till: so you interview me and I interview you
Till: that way we could get some nice thoughts together
Dave: ohho
Dave: publish it quite raw
Till: yeah, why not
Dave: i like the sound of that
Dave: a bit unconventional
Till: :)
Till: artsy
Dave: not sure it'll get published
Dave: but who cares
Dave: we publish it
Till: it doesn't have to be all interview
Dave: i should have a look at prior papers in that journal
Dave: is it open access btw?
Dave: I have a go at alex if not ;)
Till: maybe we can publish the interview by ourselves and then have raw cuts from it in the journal
Till: CMJ is the brainchild of IRCAM...
Till: so: no, not openAccess
Till: but they have for every issue one paper for free, I think
Dave: that's great because I don't want people nicking my ideas ;)
Till: (facepalm)
Dave: anyway
Dave: I'll try to come up with some questions for you next week
Dave: the start that we have is good I think
Dave: but this could provide the guts of it perhaps
Dave: at some point I'd like to talk to you about executable research papers
Till: wow
Till: yesyesyesyes
Till: should we do "live" interviews?
Till: or something with prepared questions?
Dave: happier with text
Dave: but it could be over email
Dave: so question/response still
Till: nono, I mean "life" text-skypechat
Dave: oh true
Dave: perhaps
Till: but doesn't necessarily have to be
Dave: it would be in context
Till: maybe we can start with the email version
Dave: no I think maybe your right
Dave: irc for improved credibility
Till: oup
Till: youp
Till: no I have to eat something
Dave: I have to finish a presentation
Dave: (not funding proposal though)
Dave: yippie
Till: ok, see ya in a bit (tomorrow?) then
Till: yeah!
Till: or lets see
Dave: possibly tomorrow, more likely monday
Till: yes
Till: say greetings to the family, please!
Dave: have a great weekend (still snow?)
Dave: oskar says hi
Till: it's -7 ºC
Till: how's amber?
Dave: she's good - got a lectureship job here
Dave: finally fixed career after finnish 'issue'
Till: wonderful!
Till: ah, how far is Cambridge from you?
Till: I'll heading there in may
Dave: estimate 6.5 hours train
Till: wow
Till: maybe... hmm...
Dave: not so far just UK
Dave: trains
Dave: and infrastructure generally
Dave: but if I'm in london or near around then, could meet up
Till: definitely
Dave: are you going to ZKM live.code.fest?
Till: yepp
Till: (at least I got a performance in...)
Dave: see you there then first
Till: :)
Till: what will you do?
Dave: slub
Till: slub?
Till: ah
Dave: just gig
Till: I'll have Oulipop
Till: with sara
Till: based on BBlocker
Till: :)
Dave: Oulipop?
Dave: link
Till: http://tai-studio.org/index.php/projects/chipinterpretations/oulipop/
Dave: ah yesyes
Dave: that's really great!
Till: :)
Till: thanks
Till: :)
Dave: cu soon
Till: yeah!
Till: :)
Till: (wave)
Till: hey dave, when should we start the interviewing thing?
Dave: not possible for me until thursday :(
Dave: was thinking though
Dave: might be worth writing up all betablocker blog entries into something
Dave: from my POV it's forms a fairly coherent thread
Till: yepp, that's what I thought as well
Dave: if you do the same
Dave: then it will give us probably most of the content
Dave: we can look at ways of splicing them together
Dave: and then have a discussion based on this
Dave: (I'll try to do this on Wednesday, I have a long train journey)
Till: ok, let's go for that then.
Till: I also put my initial question draft into the git
Till: maybe it helps you to formulate?
Till: http://tai-studio.org/index.php/2013/01/betablocker-paper-structure-draft/
