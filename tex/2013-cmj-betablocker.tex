% + how people imagine computation now (scary stuff) (Dave)

Computation is odd. 
In fact in many ways it's one of the strangest things that have been discovered, and 77 years on we continue to fail to fully grasp it's behaviour and so, struggle to keep unseen ramifications of our decisions under control. Faced with such a strange and yet essential beast the only sane strategy is to try and tame it. 
The field of software engineering is littered with concepts such as regression testing, type checking, white rooms, sandboxing, contracts, and encapsulation -- all attempts to cope with the fact that we can't really understand how a mundane machine of sufficient complexity will act when it is programmed by a human.

Livecoders look this beast straight in the eyes. 
When a livecoding performer takes to the stage and projects her screen, she invites us to join her in attempting to understand this intricate dance between human and machine. 

But livecoding is more than performance practice.
It is a broad field that can be viewed from many different angles.
From rehearsed public performances, reaching over collaborative improvisations and individual sound explorations, to it's utilisation as a method in science, it has been utilised in a manifold of applications.
All these derivations of the original theme share elements of live coding as they are featured in the toplap manifesto.
So livecoding is attempting to treat computation as a material on it's own terms, pick it up and feel what shapes it has.

Betablocker is an approach to livecoding which has brought to light many different strategies for presenting computation as a tangible material -- and it does this by making this process as much part of the performance as the code that describes it.
Built around this element is a variety of applications for testing, performing and scientific as well as artistic investigations.

\section*{BetaBlocker core technology} % (fold)
\label{sec:betablocker_core}

% describing the theoretical background and implementation (switch statement etc.)

The Betablocker core is a simple multithreaded virtual machine following the \emph{von Neumann architecture} design pattern where there is no separation between code and data.
It's uncrashable, so every possible program will run, although it will halt in infinite loops. 
It has 23 instructions whose width is either 8 or 16bit for those that take operands. The heap is constrained to 256 bytes of memory, while each thread has 8 bytes of stack.

\section{Unfolding self modification to livecode collaboration} % (fold)
\label{sec:unfolding_self_modification_to_livecode_collaboration}

\subsection*{Slow computing} % (fold)
\label{sub:slow_computing}
%  describing the nintendoDS part of the implementation
It began as a highly graphical fluxus based livecoding environment to be performed with the use of a gamepad (debuted at Piksel Festival 200something) and later moved on to the Gameboy DS in order to make use of it's particular graphics processing, sound chip and stylus input method -- while the small screen on the device is projected by the use of a webcam.

% TODO: more detail, also technical level... graphical interface, why you chose the grid gui etc.

Betablocker/Slow (the Fluxus/DS version) makes computation tangible by slowing down processes by many orders of magnitude. 
The smallest musical loop in Betablocker/Slow is 3 instructions long -- push a value onto the stack, play it as a note, jump back to start. 
In order to play this at 120 BPM it will need to run at 6 cycles per second, the machine I am typing on peaks at $2.8*10^9$ cycles per second, which is 466 million times faster than Betablocker/Slow. This makes computation audible as techno music, and simultaneously visible as the thread's positions are displayed on the livecoding interface synced with the audio along with the entire heap's memory contents - forming a complete state vector of the processor.

Performing with Betablocker/Slow consists of starting with empty memory and manually writing programs that modify themselves and each other.
Eventually the quantity of self replicating fork bombs, sequencers interpreting memory as percussion synth triggers and programs busily reversing the contents of memory reaches a level where the performer is confronted with a Turing soup which is happily writing it's own code. 
At this point the decision is whether to collaborate or compete.
Collaboration involves looking for interesting bits of code that emerge and manually modifying them, while the best strategy for competing is attempting to find a space to write a program that gradually clears memory so you can start again. 
In most successful performances both choices are made over the course of the concert.

\subsection*{Sound computing} % (fold)
\label{sub:sound_computing}
%   + SuperCollider (Till)

An alternative way of dealing with the Beatblocker engine was to run it at audio speed in order to directly render sound with it.
To achieve this, we wrapped it to be a SuperCollider UGen.
There are two different UGens, Demand rate and MultiOut.
