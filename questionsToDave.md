## why did you start the work with BetaBlocker?

Originally, I started to work with Betablocker because my interest was in examining the materiality of data. 
The utilising of an uncrasheable low-level machine designed for data processing that can be modified and accessed easily was an indeal choice since it allowed the addition of audio probes such that it was able to listen to the processing of the data.

## What is BetaBlocker?

well... sufficiently answered in the section "BBlocker core technology".

## What makes BetaBlocker distinct to other approaches of computation?

BetaBlocker's distinction to other approaches of computation is manyfold:
+ Because it is implemented as a sofware emulation, it can be easily modified, allowing to add e.g. probes or to vary its instruction set.
+ The formal structure of Betablocker is rather minimal, complexity therefore arises out of the induced data, resp. of the combination of that data and it's processing.
+ The main purpose of Betablocker is not the outcome of the computation but to be able to observe the process of computation itself. 

## What makes BetaBlocker distinct to other approaches of sound generation?

I will speak only about the Betablocker soundspeed derivative here.
Due to the way, the sound signal is derived from the Betablocker engine, namely probing the items on one of its functional parts -- the stack --, the shape of the waveform is limited. However, this limitation is inherent to the structure of the system itself.
Although the system is deterministic, i.e., it's outcome can be calculated supposed its state is known, it is so complex that we rather work with empirics than with analytical approaches.
